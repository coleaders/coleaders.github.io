They embrace differences without fear or conflict, loving and respecting these differences. Through "speaking, listening, staying with differences and conflicts, and feeling with all senses," they engage in self-dialogue and dialogue with close relationships. Such leaders courageously shift from dialogue to a future of co-creation.</p>

          <p class="honbun">We also chose to be a stepfamily. Venturing into the unknown was daunting because there were no clear answers. Therefore, we made choices that were true to ourselves, carefully discussing what we really thought, one topic at a time.</p>
          <p class="honbun">Our journey was accompanied by "systemic coaching," a form of dialogue. Through discussions involving many anxieties and conflicts about various important themes like "last names," "terms of address," "ways of living," "family finances," "relations with parents," "wedding ceremonies," and "relationships with children," we were able to find <strong>our own answers.</strong></p>
